RULES:

THE DEAL
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down, in front of him.

THE PLAY
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.

HOW TO KEEP SCORE
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

NEXT ASSIGNMENT
--git familiar
--have everything working w/client class
--war players (the people) should have a unique identifier (generated by your program) when they first connect to your server that they can reuse to connect in the future... that way if they get disconnected they can reconnect as the same player in the same game, plus be able to keep track of how many games they've won or lost... it's okay if the player can only play one game at a time [STRETCH]
--the only people who can play is someone who gives you a unique identifier [STRETCH]
--the server must allow multiple simultaneous games at one time
--no games should be blocked by another game
--players must tell you when it is okay to play the next card

War players (the people) should have a unique identifier when they first connect to your server that they can reuse to connect in the future.
The only people who can play is someone who gives you a unique identifier.
And the server must allow multiple simultaneous games at one time.
A player can only participate in one game at a time.
No games should be blocked by another game.
Players must tell you when it is ok to play the next card

The first two are stretch goals:
War players (the people) should have a unique identifier when they first connect to your server that they can reuse to connect in the future.
The only people who can play is someone who gives you a unique identifier.
